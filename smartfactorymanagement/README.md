# 🏭 Real-Time Smart Factory Automation System
### AI + Digital Twin + GNN + RL + Drone Thermal Inspection

A next-generation Industry 4.0 system integrating Digital Twin Simulation, Predictive Maintenance, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), PPO Reinforcement Learning, and Drone-based Thermal Vision into one unified intelligent manufacturing ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 1. Motivation
Manufacturing industries face unplanned failures, high maintenance costs, lack of visibility, and slow manual inspections.  
This project enables **self-monitoring, self-predictive, and self-optimizing factories** using layered AI intelligence.
